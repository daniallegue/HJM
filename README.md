# HJM

This code uses historcal rates with 51 different tenors to estimate the future rates influenced by the Heath-Jarrow-Morton model by leveraging the principal component analysis (PCA) of the covariance matrix. Then, the forward rates are used to compute the value of a caplet using the Black Caplet formula.
